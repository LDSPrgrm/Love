      content: `Hello, baby! I just want to take a moment to tell you <br>
        how much I appreciate you. <br><br>
        Life gets so hectic, and I know there are days <br>
        when I can’t be as sweet as I want to be, <br>
        when exhaustion takes over, when words fall short, <br>
        and I fail to show you just how much you mean to me.<br><br>

        But please know that through every passing moment, every tired silence, <br>
        and even on the days when I don’t say it enough, in the midst of it all, <br>
        you are my peace, my comfort, my heart’s truest home.<br><br>

        Thank you for your patience, for your understanding, <br>
        and for staying by my side no matter what, <br>
        even when my time and energy are stretched thin.<br><br>
        Your love, your presence, and your unwavering support mean everything to me. <br>
        I carry you with me always, in every thought, in every beat of my heart.<br><br>

        I cherish every moment we share, every glance, <br>
        every touch, every quiet moment of simply being together. <br>
        And I look forward to the countless more waiting for us. <br>
        No matter what, you are loved by me deeply, endlessly, and forever.<br><br>

        Happy Valentine’s Day, baby.<br>
        Today and always, my heart will forever be yours.<br><br>
        
        Forever yours, <br>
